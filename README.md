## About Me

Nowadays, the world of marketing, sales and business has changed drastically based on Technology. Automation has started its role in Industry 4.0.

Over the past few years, I've been actively involved in volunteering to inspire and support youth in the fields of research, business development, and sportsmanship. I thrive in collaborative environments and am deeply motivated to lead teams towards achieving success.

I'm currently in my final semester of post-graduation in Information Technology at IIT, Jahangirnagar University. Have a nice day.
