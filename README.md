## About Me

In today's fast-evolving world, technology is reshaping the way we approach marketing, business, and innovation. With the rise of Industry 4.0, automation and intelligent systems are becoming the backbone of modern enterprises. Iâ€™m currently working full-time as a Junior Software Test Engineer at WPDeveloper, while pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Information & Communication Technology at Jahangirnagar University. As part of my academic journey, Iâ€™ve also started an Erasmus+ Exchange Semester at Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen in Germany, focusing on research and master thesis work in cutting-edge tech domains.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve contributed to multiple organizations across diverse rolesâ€”from business development and research to testing and software quality assurance. Alongside this, Iâ€™ve taken pride in mentoring young minds and leading initiatives that promote entrepreneurship, sportsmanship, and personal growth.
